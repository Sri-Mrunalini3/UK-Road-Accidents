# UK-Road-Accidents
Power BI Dashboard <br/>
Problem Statement: <br/>
The objective of this assignment is to analyze the UK road accident dataset and gain insights into factors affecting road safety and accident severity. By examining the dataset, we aim to explore various aspects of road accidents and address the following questions. By addressing these questions and conducting exploratory analysis on the UK road accident dataset, we aim to gain insights into road safety and accident prevention.<br/>
Steps: Used Visual Cards to show the total Casualties, average speed limit.</br>
       Presented Pie chart to display the police force has the highest number of reported accidents. <br/>
       Utilized Column chart with advanced filtering to know the districts that have more than 1000 number of reported accidents. <br/>
       Displayed Column chart to asees which type of vechicles are involved in the highest number of accidents. <br/>
       Used Scatter chart to determine the relationship between the number of vehicles involved in an accident and the average of casualties. <br/>
       Utilized drill down filter in a line chart to know the trend of accidents over date (year, qtr, months or even a day) in the UK. <br/>
       Incorporated Sorted bar chart to know about thecertain junction types that are more commonly associated with accidents. <br/>
       Applied Top N filtering to see the districts that are most affected in terms of accidents. <br/>
       Used Clistured Column chart to know about the How did road surface conditions affect accident severity. </br>
       Added a slicer for accident severity and district to filter the entire report page.</br>
Insights: <br/>
T junctions are the hotspot for accidents. <br/>
Cars vehicle are more prone to accidents. <br/>
Westminster, Lambeth, Barnet are the districts with more than 1000 accidents. <br/>
As the number of vehicles involved in accident increases, the average casualties increases. <br/>
Dry road surfaces are accident prone zones. <br/>
98% accidents were investigated by Metropolitan police. <br/>
Recommendation: <br/>
Keep T junction ahead and speed limitation board road sign. <br/>
Conduct road safety programs in various districts. <br/>
Ambulance facilities in accident prone districts (Westminster, Lambeth,Barnet). <br/>
Mandate airbags in cars. <br/>
Improve dry roads conditions. <br/>
Challan for overspeeding. <br/>
